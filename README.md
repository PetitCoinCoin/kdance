### KDance registration

This program (`KDance registration`) is a Django based web app.

It is designed to help associations to handle their members database. It was specifically designed for the K'Dance association, thus, there are a lot of specific features / hardcoded stuff. Nevertheless, I believe it can be useful for any other association, with a few modifications.

##### To run locally
Create a `.env` file with env variables in `kdance` folder. See the [settings file](./kdance/kdance/settings.py) to know what variables are expected.
```sh
cd kdance
docker compose up
```

In your browser, go to `http://localhost:8000` :tada:

##### Maintenance and evolution
I'm more or less active on this repo, depending on the needs of the association. Nevertheless, this is some kind of (big) pet project for me, and I want to take the opportunity to improve various stuff: code of course, but also deployment, testing and so on. Feel free to reach out for any comment or advice.
